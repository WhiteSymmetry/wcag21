      <h1>Understanding Adapting text</h1>

         <h2>Intent</h2>
         <p>The intent of this Success Criterion is to help ensure that people  with low vision who override spacing or font family (also  called font face or typeface) can read text.  Some people with disabilities  override author settings via user  stylesheet, bookmarklet, extension, or application. A user may need to change font family to effectively read text. They may increase spacing between lines (also called leading), words, and letters to effectively read text. Line spacing also helps with tracking. Tracking is following along lines of text, including getting from the end of one line to the beginning of the next line of text.</p>
         <p>For this Success Criterion the canvas implementation of text is considered  to be <a>images of text</a>.</p>

            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>People with low vision who require increased space between lines, words and letters are to  able to read text.</li>
               <li>People with low vision have clickable links, when a large font-family is selected and/or increased spacing is applied to text. </li>
            </ul>

      <section id="examples">
         <h2>Examples</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Text does not wrap out of the containing box or cause boxes to overlap when a large font-family is selected and/or increased spacing is applied to text. </li>
            <li>Links are operable when a large font-family is selected and/or increased spacing is applied to text. </li>

            <p>This section references techniques that can be used to meet the Guideline or Success Criterion. There are sub-sections for sufficient techniques, advisory techniques, and failures. </p>
            <ul>
               <li>Within each sub-section, there may be "situations" to describe when a set of techniques need to be considered. Remove the sub-section and heading if situations are not used.</li>
               <li>Techniques are provided in an unordered list. Reference techniques by linking to the filename of the technique and using the technique ID as link text. Use unlinked plain text if the technique has not been written yet.</li>
               <li>If more than one technique must be used for full sufficiency, list them in the same bullet separated by "AND".</li>
               <li>If a general technique requires technology-specific techniques to be implemented, end the bullet with "using" and provide a sub-list of those techniques.</li>
               <li>Square brackets indicate optional components.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remove any parts of the template that are not used, such as the section and heading for situations, sub-lists of techniques, or the "AND" construction. Also remove the square brackets around placeholder optional components.</p>
